She is a patriotic girl. Lazyass-smart girl and she wants to be a lawyer. But I don't think so ðŸ™‚. She like the smell of new things so much, especially the CASH ðŸ™‚(weirdo). She makes me think twice what I will say is the truth she want or the truth she believe. When the game is downside, your heart is bound to break from her freeze eyes ðŸ™‚ (really scary!). Out of all things, nothing is really matter because she is already positioning and acts like a part of me. And more and more I can write but this is all for now.
